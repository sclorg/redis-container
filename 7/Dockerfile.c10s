ENV SUMMARY="Redis in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker" \
    DESCRIPTION="Redis $REDIS_VERSION available as container, is an advanced key-value store. \
It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, \
sets and sorted sets. You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; \
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; \
or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set. In order to achieve its outstanding \
performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist \
it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log."

# Create user for redis that has known UID

# The UID is the one used by the default user from the parent layer (1001),
# and since the user exists already, do not create a new one, but only rename
# the existing
# This image must forever use UID 1001 for redis user so our volumes are
# safe in the future. This should *never* change, the last test is there
# to make sure of that.
